# -Remote-IoT-data-monitoring-and-control-using-Wi-Fi
In this project, the Arduino board is connected to Wi-Fi module and both act as a server. The Arduino Board is connected to 2 LEDs, 3 sensors (temperature, smoke, motion). The client which is a web browser - running on any computer connected to the same network as the Arduino- communicates to the server and controls it.
